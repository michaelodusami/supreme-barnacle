The terms **upper bound** and **lower bound** establish the range or limits for a value, a result, or an error. They define the maximum and minimum values a quantity can possibly take.

### General Mathematical Definition

| Term | Simple Meaning | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Bound** | A value that is **greater than or equal to** every possible value of the quantity you are measuring. It sets the **maximum limit**. | A 100-yard dash time will always have an upper bound of infinity (it can take forever), and a sensible upper bound of, say, 15 seconds (no human runs slower than that). |
| **Lower Bound** | A value that is **less than or equal to** every possible value of the quantity you are measuring. It sets the **minimum limit**. | The time taken to run a 100-yard dash will always have a lower bound of **0 seconds** (you can't finish before you start), and a practical lower bound of about **9.5 seconds** (the current world record). |

## Meaning in the Context of Accuracy

When the statement says:
> "the **irreducible error** will always provide an **upper bound** on the **accuracy** of our prediction for $Y$."

This means:

1.  **Accuracy is a Measurement of Performance:** In this context, "accuracy" likely refers to a metric where a *higher* number is *better* (e.g., $R^2$ or a percentage correct).
2.  **The Irreducible Error is the Limit:** Since **irreducible error** ($\epsilon$) is the unavoidable noise in the system, it represents the absolute **best** a model can possibly do. Even a theoretically perfect model ($\hat{f}=f$) cannot overcome this noise.
3.  **Upper Bound Interpretation:** Because you can never eliminate the irreducible error, the model's accuracy (or performance) **can never be higher** than the limit set by this error.

| Quantity | Bound Set By Irreducible Error |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prediction Accuracy (Performance)** | **Upper Bound** (Maximum Achievable Performance) |
| **Prediction Error (MSE, RMSE)** | **Lower Bound** (Minimum Achievable Error) |

**In short:** The **irreducible error** puts a *cap* on how good your model can ever be. No matter how much you improve your modeling technique, your prediction accuracy cannot exceed the level of the true, underlying relationship that is masked by random noise.
