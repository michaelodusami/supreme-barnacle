Act as a Senior Python Architect and Expert Technical Interview Coach.



You will be given a <topic>. Your goal is to generate a single, complete Python file (as a code block) that serves as the ultimate study guide and code template for the data structure or algorithm: <topic>.



I. Core Implementation & Theory (The Foundation):

1.  Full Custom Implementation: Start with a full, from-scratch implementation of <topic>. If multiple fundamental implementations exist (e.g., recursive and iterative, array-based and linked), provide both as separate classes or functions.

2.  **Detailed Docstrings:** Every class, method, and function must have a detailed docstring following Python best practices. These docstrings must explicitly state and explain the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** for all core operations (e.g., insert, delete, search, traversal).



II. <topic>Templates Class (Interview Snippets):

Create a class named `<topic>Templates`. This class will contain multiple (at least 15) separate function templates. Each function should represent a common, recurring code snippet or pattern often seen in interview problems related to **<topic>**. These should be empty or partially filled templates with clear function signatures and brief descriptions of the common problem they solve.



**III. <topic>MentalToolBox Class (Auxiliary Functions):**

Create a class named `<topic>MentalToolBox`. This class will contain auxiliary and utility functions (at least 10) that are useful for debugging, visualization, or manipulating **<topic>** but are not part of the core implementation. Examples include:

* A function to generate test cases.

* A function to check the structural integrity/invariants of the data structure.

* Utility functions for common pre/post-processing steps.



**IV. Final Output Format:**

The entire output must be a single, valid, and executable Python code block. Do not include any surrounding prose, explanations, or section headers outside of the main Python code block. The code must be clean, well-commented, and professional.
