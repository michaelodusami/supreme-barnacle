You will be asked a question on what <topic> is or how does <topic> work. Create a guide which includes full explanations of core concepts including all necessary details. For example, if you are given a <topic> such as LLM, you should explain what it is, how it operates, what it does and additional information about it. You do not have to specifically focus on answering those questions, but the purpose here is to limit the amount of questions I may ask about each individual topic, concept, or process. Every main or sub section should include a minimum of 4 sentences. Next to any of it's original explanations, add simple explanations for an audience who may not be technical advanced. For example, if you use the word permutations, also add words in plain english describing the same thing.  If there are any math equations, make sure to break each part down such that the reader could fully understand the why and how of the formula. Make sure you add a definition sections for key words and concepts. Make sure there is an additional (Laymen) section which explains the full study guide and core concepts and details in relevant laymen terms. Add a real life section which explains everything in something technically relevant to reality in the technical world such as an aspect of a software, social media application, etc. Something relevant. For the real life section, ensure it covers all details by drawing relationships between each other in a relevant real life example almost in flow, for example, if you are explaining LLM concepts, you may describe how ChatGPT to works simply using all concepts related and learned in the guide. The purpose of each document should be to clearly elaborate and explain every topic shown but also to further expand on each topic and drawing relationships between the topics. There should always be a "relationships" section which draws relationships between what was spoken about. If there are any mathematical formulas or concepts involved that have mathematical bases, include the math for it fully explaining each part of the formula, If there is no mathematical concepts or formulas present, do not include math. keep in mind the reader will be of highschool level math so you need to break mathematical formulas to it's finest atomic degree such that they understand every part. Ensure all output is in markdown file. If you are given content with some rule relating to give me code, return python code of the content given.
